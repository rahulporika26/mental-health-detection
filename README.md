# 🧠 Mental Health Detection Using NLP

This repository explores multiple machine learning and deep learning approaches for **multi-class mental health status detection** based on user-generated text data.

Our models classify text into **7 categories**:

* Anxiety
* Bipolar
* Depression
* Normal
* Personality Disorder
* Stress
* Suicidal

---

## 📂 Repository Contents

* `DistilBERT_model_91%.ipynb` → Fine-tuned DistilBERT model achieving **91% accuracy**
* `biLSTM+pretrained_word2vec_model.ipynb` → BiLSTM with pretrained Word2Vec embeddings
* `An_Ensemble_Machine_Learning_Pipeline.ipynb` → Hybrid ML + DL ensemble approach
* `balanced_dataset_clean_zz.csv` → Processed & balanced dataset
* `Original_dataset.csv` → Raw dataset (before preprocessing)

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of user-generated mental health statements labeled into **7 categories**.

**Preprocessing steps:**

* Removed stopwords, URLs, and special characters
* Balanced classes to handle class imbalance
* Tokenized and padded sequences for deep learning models

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We conducted:

* Class distribution analysis (bar & pie charts)
* Word clouds for each category
* Text length distribution
* Most frequent words per class

---

## 🧪 Models Implemented

### 1️⃣ DistilBERT (Transformers)

* **Tokenizer:** `DistilBertTokenizerFast`
* **Model:** `TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification`
* **Optimizer:** AdamW + learning rate scheduler

**Performance:**

* Accuracy: **91.06%**
* Strong across most classes, slight dip for **Depression** & **Suicidal**

---

### 2️⃣ BiLSTM + Pretrained Word2Vec

* **Embedding:** Pretrained Google News Word2Vec
* **Architecture:** Bi-directional LSTM with dropout
* **Output:** Dense softmax classification layer

---

### 3️⃣ Ensemble Machine Learning

* **Models used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
* **Ensemble method:** Soft voting (probability-based)
* **Benefit:** Improved macro-average F1 score

| Bipolar              | 0.97      | 0.98   | 0.98     |
| Depression           | 0.76      | 0.72   | 0.74     |
| Normal               | 0.95      | 0.95   | 0.95     |
| Personality Disorder | 0.99      | 0.98   | 0.98     |
| Stress               | 0.95      | 0.97   | 0.96     |
| Suicidal             | 0.78      | 0.80   | 0.79     |

**Overall Performance:**

* ✅ **Accuracy:** 91.06%
* ✅ **Macro F1-score:** 0.91

Do you also want me to add **visuals** (like confusion matrix and class distribution charts) in the README format, so your GitHub repo looks more polished?
